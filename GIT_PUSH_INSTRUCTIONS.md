# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

## Repository Information
- **Recommended Name**: `epstein-network-graph` (from spec/GITHUB_REPOSITORY.md)
- **Current Size**: ~1.2GB (mostly images)
- **Status**: Ready to push

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository Online
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `epstein-network-graph` (or your chosen name)
3. Description: "Making Epstein network documents searchable through data science. Extracts and structures data from the 50th Birthday Book, Black Book, and Flight Logs for Neo4j graph analysis and natural language querying."
4. Public repository
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Git in github-ready Directory

```bash
# Navigate to github-ready directory
cd /home/dleer/Projects/pdf-intelligence/github-ready

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Epstein network document analysis project

- Structured extraction data (v1 complete, v2 in progress)
- Cropped images for all three documents
- Processing scripts for image manipulation
- External validated data sources
- Documentation for contributors

Making public documents searchable through data science."
```

### 3. Connect to GitHub and Push

```bash
# Add remote (replace [username] with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/epstein-network-graph.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Repository Settings

Once pushed, configure on GitHub:

#### Repository Settings

  - `epstein-documents`
  - `network-analysis`
  - `knowledge-graph`
  - `neo4j`
  - `document-extraction`
  - `data-science`
  - `graphrag`
  - `multimodal-ai`
  - `open-data`

#### Features to Enable
- ✅ Issues (for community corrections)
- ✅ Discussions (for OSINT collaboration)
- ⬜ Wiki (optional - for detailed methodology)

### 5. Post Reddit Response (Optional)

See `spec/GITHUB_REPOSITORY.md` for the prepared Reddit response to /u/nicko170

## Important Notes

### This is a SEPARATE Repository
- The github-ready directory becomes its OWN independent git repository
- It has NO connection to your private `/home/dleer/Projects/pdf-intelligence` work
- You can continue working privately without affecting the public repo

### Updating the Public Repo Later
When you want to update the public repo:

```bash
# Make changes in github-ready directory
cd /home/dleer/Projects/pdf-intelligence/github-ready

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Update: [describe changes]"

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Large Files Warning
- Total size: ~1.2GB
- GitHub has a 1GB repository size warning
- Individual files >50MB will fail
- Consider using Git LFS if needed

### Check for Large Files
```bash
cd /home/dleer/Projects/pdf-intelligence/github-ready
find . -type f -size +50M
```
