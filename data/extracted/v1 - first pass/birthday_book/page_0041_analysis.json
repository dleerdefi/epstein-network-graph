Custom painted in an aqua blue flamy car color, this eye catcher dazzles all onlookers. With it's four-on-the-floor Hurst T-shifter, twin Holley 4 barrel carbs, a blue printed 454 Hemi, headers and extra leaf springs, Sgt. Gene brags, 'whattayamean?,,, it gets up to 50 on the Belt Pkwy. ....why these Sea Gate snot rags could only dream of owning a supercar like this'.\n\nCap, Gown And What??\nBy Stanley Komito\nLafayette Legend\n\nFour rebellious Sea Gate boys, two of whom barely graduated, were caught wearing dungarees and Beatle Boots under their graduation gowns. The graduation exercises took place at a famous movie theater in downtown Brooklyn. One of the cocky boys remarked 'Hey what are they gonna fail me now??'\n\n2 Barely Graduate\nBy Carl Ashby\nHealth Ed Journal\n\nAfter making a mockery of phys-ed class for the majority of their senior year, Coach Gary Lasker pulled two teens from gym class 6 weeks before graduation and gave them the bad news: they weren't going to graduate!! Although the 2 boys had virtually straight A's in academics, they were total losers when it came to gym. They pleaded with Mr. Lasker and asked what they could do to make it up. After thinking about a just punishment, he required the students to double time in every gym class. They had to do twice the exercise, twice the running, as well as lead the class in exercise until the end of the school year. Lasker also humiliated the boys in front of each and every class, but allowed them to graduate with a grade of one point over the minimum passing grade of 65.\n\nYellow Laundry Mystery Solved\nBy Beatrice K. Cooper\nRead a Book-a-Day Club\n\nAn obese Sea Gate family started to notice that their laundry mysteriously started turning yellow every time they removed it from (cont'd pg. 6, column 1)",
