Variations in color and surface markings are natural characteristics of fine leather and are your assurance of its quality. The buttery softness of calfskin give it great tactile appeal and lends itself to easy scuffing which develops into an exquisite antique patina. We recommend that the binding be treated with lanolin and gristfoot oil at least once a year. You may bring in your WEITZ-COLEMAN binding for a complimentary treatment.\n\nWEITZ & SIMPLY THE FINEST BOOKBINDING - ESTABLISHED 1909\nCOLEMAN - 1377 LEXINGTON AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10128\n(212) 831-2213\nwww.weitzcoleman.com\nwww.albumsalbums.com",
