    "text": "Dearest Jeffrey,\n\nIf I were to list my life time achievements, surely scoring higher than you on the nineth grade algebra regent would rank in the top ten. I'll never forget the exhilaration of considering myself smarter than Jeffrey Epstein for the same year, you not only performed mathematical magic by tutoring me to get a perfect score on the regent, you thrilled our class in music by playing 'California Dreaming' on the piano, and thrilled me even more by stealing a kiss after 'The Sound of Music' at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nWhen we met again some time after college, you had shoulder length curls, wore wonderful hand-embroidered denim work shirts and tight jeans, and drove a brown Camaro with a glove compartment full of parking tickets. Needless to say, you had outgrown your shyness around girls and even confessed that you participated in peace marches because they were the easiest places to get laid. A truly unique perspective on political activism in the 70's.\n\nA few years later during a trip to Palm Beach, we were driving around admiring the homes when you pointed in the direction of a particularly impressive mansion and said, 'One day, I'm going to own that.' I smiled and considered your comment nothing more than wishful thinking. Many mansions later, you have shown me the importance of having a vision and the determination to pursue it. A lesson I continue to rely upon for inspiration.\n\nFrom lessons in algebra to lessons in life, the lessons I've learned from you during the past 35 years haven't always been easy or even ones that I would have chosen to learn, but they were always important. I'm very grateful to have you for a friend and hope that if you ever need help solving a rate/time/distance problem, you won't hesitate to call.\n\nAll my love,\n[REDACTED]",
