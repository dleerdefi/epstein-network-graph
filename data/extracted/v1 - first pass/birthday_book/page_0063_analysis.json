    "text": "JOHNNY BOY KAFKA\n3917 GLENDORA AVE.\nDALLAS, TEXAS 75230\n214 987 3595\n\nJanuary 15, 2003\nDallas,Texas\n\nDearest Jeff:\n\nFifty years old. You really have had a pretty amazing life. Amazing because of where and when it started. Paula and Seymour fucking. Who was there to tell him where to stick it? Who told him to spit on her cunt to make it wet? Maybe they had more on the ball then we all give them credit for.\n\nAnyway from that day and year in May of 1953, give or take two there intoxicated from lovemaking little did they know what they would be bringing into the world early the next year. Lets fast forward to you. I remember what you were like that first day you ever work some slut ass job (Dalton) for minimum wage, I would always find something (Male Ego in Brighton Beach) and Frog would too (Cabana Boy). But you, Jeff would never work. Yes, you were special. You did things like music camps in Michigan, etc. Which brings me to when you lost your virginity. You may not remember, but I was under the same roof that could new years eve in '66 or '67 (not sure). The first time I ever flew wets with you. I went with you to Michigan to visit your friend [REDACTED] the Intellechant girl for new years eve. It was also the first time I had ever laid eyes on a bright, attractive, bubbly, blue eyed, mid western female. She was like an alien to me. She was so fresh, so Julian. Words like yehh, right, ok. I'm with you in Michigan where I spent most of the summer with Lloyd and Andy working at Playland Arcade in Montecello. It was Lloyd's girlfriend. Anyway, back to the Michigan trip, because it was significant. Jeff, you took me with you. It was my first time out of Brooklyn. It was no big deal, but we went. And nobody else ever WENT anywhere back when and where we came from.\n\nAnd then on to Europe. The second time I ever flew. Sabena Airlines to Brussels. Wasn't it $800 RT. In Europe, I really saw a true transformation in you. You lost all of your clumsiness and I remember noticing that you grew a few inches. We both got absolutely skinny in those weeks abroad. I will always remember how you were wandering thru dark Frank watching all those nude window's world knows it was, Love cheese on bread and arriving to our destinations in the morning ready to hit the sites. We'd drink in all that the cities had to offer on a budget of $2 a day. Author Frommer's EUROPE ON $5 A DAY was for suckers. We did it cheaper, deeper, wider and better. We saw and learned so much on that memorable trip. We hitch hiked, we hiked, we trained, we ferried, we walked, use mi, we always somehow managed to get where we wanted to go and see what we wanted to see. We slept on trains, boats, benches, abandoned houses, flop houses, people's homes, friend's aps. Everywhere but hotels and hostels. We were too savvy to stay in a youth hostel \"wasn't it me?\" Hell, I can't remember thousands of dollars a n hour (paid cash in my days. We couldn't one less shekel food. But we did enjoy all that cheese and bread and train station soup. Remember, our first night in Brussels. It probably was our worst. But, we did steal two heavy, itchy blankets from that youth hostel. It was freezing and wet. But things went way up from there. Especially the time I had a wet dream sleeping in my seat on the ferry from Brindizi (or Bari?) to Corfu. Did I share that with you? Remember the Corfu police detained me on arrival to the Island? We had some scary moments. That's what made it such a great experience. We stayed on Corfu for 2 weeks or so. Never got to London because of that. Corfu was great on pie budget and I remember it being great sleeping on the beach with nude Girls from all over the world. Mud mi [REDACTED] no and those two girls from Cleveland.\n\nThat trip to Europe could get more space but the main point is that it really opened your eyes to another world. And mine too. But you left seized it. I did too in a sense. But you spent the next summer in London and came home with a beautiful British babe named [REDACTED]. You had such churpah to",
