    "text": "bring her to your beautiful, civilized, impressive home on Maple Ave. Think back on that now. That shows it is. It really takes a man with vision a shit about what she thought. And she couldn't have been too impressed. You weren't worried about first (I suspect) you're on tight. Never worried, always confident. That aspect of your personality, of course coupled with your brilliance and intellect is what made you who and what you are today. This don't give a shit attitude, your calculated slodiness, your sense of humor and most importantly that confidence came to you early on. You had to have confidence and as I don't give a shit attitude to bring [REDACTED] into your Sea Gate world. It worked! You began to realize that you could get away with shit! That chicks and people in general were schmucks! You sensed that you were sharper and more astute than most.\n\nEspecially the ones who had women, money, position and power. Yes, your charisma and persuasive ways came very early on. And you didn't learn life's lessons in your house. You learned them from us (me, frog, WD) from Europe, Interlochen, our trips to the city and the people you met along the way. Maybe you picked up a little from Timmy, too. Remember meeting Phyllis? He's hot. He knew shit, but always remember how you said that Timmy taught you a lot about business. I know you enhanced that a bit, but that was a great thing to say to a kid., and I'll never forget it either. As often said Phyllis are crazy about each other and the kid is obviously enamoured by you and mixed meeting you. It meant a lot to him and me. He's really a great kid – has that easy going, confident manner. Good looking kid.\n\nSo now you're fifty. No sweat Jeff. You look great, you're probably in the best shape of your life and you're not slowing down one bit. If no one told you how old you were – wouldn't you think you were 36 or something? Just don't get bored and age healthy.\n\nAnd then there's Warren. He's as hilarious as ever and exactly the same as he was 35 yrs. ago with his trench coat and his business man's boots BACK THEN! We see each other pretty often. When can Warren and I get together w/ you for at least an evening and just get Warren shikered, you know the way we used to. Maybe we need to include Zucca in a prop to Warren.\n\nIf you look at our little group of you , Warren, Frog and me. We were very close, although we never said or knew it back then. We didn't know girlfriends, we never even dated. We didn't look to our families really for anything, we had each other. That was enough high school. Then when we went to college we were still close but we each began to branch out from the group. We had great times and I'm convinced – and I know this is true. You guys made us all left. But our youth, and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about you. So Jeff, even though we don't speak that often, and our lives don't intersect, you really are a part of me and I will always be grateful for the great times we had. You have been and still are a great influence for me. You don't know it, but you're my kid's role model. That's why it's so satisfying to recall the past with you. It has shaped both of us. When Warren and I get together, who and what do you think we talk about? You, You, You. You its constant – I can't stand it anymore.\n\nThat's it for now. I know I got a bit sentimental, but it's the occasion. Take good care. I'll always have the fondest memories of our past and I can honestly say they were the best years of my life – even though I couldn't ever get laid.\n\nEternally and with love,\n\nJeanny\nJohnny Boy",
