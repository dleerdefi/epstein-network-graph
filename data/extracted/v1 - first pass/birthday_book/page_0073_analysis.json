    "text": "Dr. Stephen Levy\n6 Lewis Court\nCommack, New York 11725\n(631) 543-4783   Fax: (631) 543-4697   Cell: (516) 316-2303 e-mail: slevy@pipeline.com\n\nDecember, 2002\n\nJeffrey,\n\nYou could never imagine the surprise I felt when Ghislaine first contacted me about writing something for your memory book.\n\nOver the years I have thought of Class 5-3 & 6-3, numerous times with affection and really fond memories. After all you guys were my second class EVER and I had just transferred from my first job, which was in, of all places, Fort Apache, The Bronx! Imagine, coming from a class of hold-overs, delinquents, and worse, to a class of \"Intellectually Gifted Children.\" Believe me, it was quite a chore just to keep one step ahead of that class.\n\nOne day, about 2 weeks into the Northern State Parkway on my way to teach about 5 miles an hour, in the midst of a snowstorm, when my cell phone rang. I spent the next 15 minutes or so relieving Warren's eyes and hair, from sandy Dallas, Texas. As we talked and he reminisced and Warren's faces flashed before my eyes. I even told him.... Jeffrey, saxophone, Michael, clarinet, Warren, saxophone and so on for most of the class. He later sent me a picture of the class and then I, much better myself, thinking about these years of dark brown hair. There you were, just as I remembered you, with a Mona Lisa smile that told what was really going on in that interesting brain of yours. Who could have guessed the wonderful, fascinating things that were in it.\n\nI remember discussing Abraham Lincoln with the class and staring in wonder at the student who had read all of Sandberg's Life of Lincoln and spouted facts of which I was totally unaware. I also remember my math (never my strong suit) beginning to deteriorate from time to time, very respectfully, by Jeffrey. I also remember the Coney Island Costume Parade and performing onstage at Lafayette and blowing away the audience who had just listened to a Junior High orchestra.\n\nI have many awards and plaques on my office walls, at home and at work.... too many for any one place, but for all these years I still treasure and display the gold painted, wooden plaque that I received from your class for being the \"Best Teacher.\"\n\nI'm thrilled and delighted that you still remember me and that in some small way I may have made a difference and touched your life. Happy Birthday!\n\nIn 1963, you were around 10 and I was 23.... twice as old as you. Today you are 50 and I'm 63.... somehow you're catching up! How did that happen?\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. Stephen Levy, Principal, General Studies\nHarvey School, Katonah, NY; HASTANC, West Hempstead Campus\nPresident, PDA, Columbia University;\nMember, Children's Scholarship Fund National Teachers Advisory Board",
