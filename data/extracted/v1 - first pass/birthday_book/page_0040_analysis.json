    "text": "4\n\n[Column 1 - continuation]\ngruesome details. Sea Gate cops were unable to capture the foaming-mad Jankowitz, which resulted in the victim being forced to have 29 injections in the stomach. A Bite Alert has been announced and posted on the Sea Gate Chapel Bulletin Board.\n\nPizza Man Goes Berserk!\nBy Yetta Parnes\nYenta Times\n\nPizza man Luigi Tortoni flew into a fit of rage after employer Arthur Stern (owner of the famed restaurants, 'The Spot' and 'The Riviera Snack Bar') told Luigi that he would start using fake cheese in his pizza. Tortoni exploded and held Stern at knife point until Sgt. Gino 'Gene' Venezia of Sea Gate Police S.W.A.T. team negotiated with the mad Italian. The straight-jacketed Tortoni was promptly shipped back to Italy. Sources report that Luigi Tortoni is now a famous spumoni scoop designer frequently seen on the prestigious Vespa racing circuit.\n\n[Column 2]\nDermatologist Fights Fire\nBy Robert Ardigo\nPizza Face Pages\n\nWorld renowned Pimple Expert Dr. Shin Ho Yep claims the secret to a great complexion is in his secret formula. Hundreds of butter face teens flock to Dr. Yep's office off Ocean Pkwy. in Brooklyn to obtain much needed help. The Dr. applies his 'secret formula' to kid's faces and within seconds their skin feels like a raging inferno. Some patients wait in agony from the fiery concoction, and if they scream loud enough, Yep says 'just 10 more minutes'. If they start to cry, Dr. Yep proclaims 'OK we put out fire now'. He takes a tissue and puts 2 drops of water on it and barely dabs at the blistering skin. Chemical analysis of Yep's 'secret formula' found it to be nothing but a combination of straight hydrochloric and sulfuric acids.\nThe results: a cranberry sauce red appearance immediately after treatment, but after two weeks, all but one kinky haired Sea Gate boy, had a peaches and cream complexion.",
