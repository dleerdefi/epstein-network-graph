*Kristy Caylor is an entrepreneur and sustainability advocate, known for founding For Days, the first circular fashion brand, and being involved with Trashie, a recycling rewards platform. The evidence leans toward her having a significant impact through Maiyet, an ethically-driven luxury brand, and her early career at Gap Inc. It seems likely she continues to lead in sustainable fashion, with recent activity showing her influence in both For Days and Trashie, with an unexpected detail being the integration of TrashieCash across both platforms, enhancing consumer engagement in recycling efforts.

Paula Heil Fisher is known as one of Jeffrey Epstein's former long-term girlfriends, a relationship that reportedly spanned a significant period before they transitioned into a close friendship. A theatrical producer with credits including works like Finding Eleazar and Royal Kaliber, Fisher first met Epstein during his time at Bear Stearns, where she worked as an associate. Described as private yet connected to Epstein’s elite social circle, she remained a notable figure in his life, with Epstein himself maintaining ties to her even after their romantic involvement ended. Her background in the arts and her association with Epstein highlight a lesser-known facet of his complex personal history.

* I'm not sure if the previous Ira Zuckerman is a misspelling of Ira Zicherman or not. There is an upcoming insurance scandal that Epstein skates from, so it is possible that they're 2 different people with similar names. Oddly enough, the location and the profession of Zuckerman makes him a feasible second person.

February 21, 1993
Epstein is charged with larceny and postal theft but gets off with 5yrs probation and the charges are later dropped. Steven Hoffenberg was not as lucky.
The Palm Beach Post later ran a correction piece after Epstein cut a deal with prosecutors, claiming it was a “different” Jeffrey Epstein (it was NOT). This was very much politically motivated and done so by the people that he would continue to make “winners”. This was buried on p.2A on 6/25/2006 – the original article was completely removed from the archives. Why did they want to remove this information prior to bringing forth the sexual claims? Were the girls cover for what would eventually reveal something much bigger?

3/8/1993 - Per The Albuquerque Tribune (6/10/95), Epstein bought 5k acres of land from Gov. Bruce King and his brothers and is going to build New Mexico’s largest house – the birth of Zorro Ranch. In the article, along with 2 businesses named, it is mentioned that he was previously an officer at Lewex Inc, an investment firm of Les Wexner’s. Some of Epstein’s neighbors at the ranch are Ted Turner, Jane Fonda, Sam Donaldson, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper and Oprah Winfrey.

*Dawn Devito appears to be a private citizen who knew Epstein due to her residential location. She is a buyer for S&S Wordwide (family business), an educational, art, and craft product company. She is closer in age to Epstein and doesn't appear to have any abnormal type of connection. Likely just a neighbor, perhaps he helped her family's business.
